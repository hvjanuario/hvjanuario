								<p>I have a background in engineering and enjoy any problem solving that comes my way. 
									I'm a firm believer that any data challenge should be solved with a flexible mindset but always 
									taking into account the big picture. I'm also a good teamplayer who likes to see things through
									to the end.</p>

								<h3> - <a href="https://github.com/hvjanuario/Portfolio/tree/master/DemandForecasting">Demand Forecasting</a></h3>
								<p>The goal of this project was to predict the amount of services for a transfer company 8 weeks in advance in a 4 week window.<br>Whithin a timeframe of 3 weeks, our team developed a model that was able to predict the demand for the company within a 10% margin of error.</br></p>
								
								<h3> - <a href="https://github.com/hvjanuario/Portfolio/tree/master/ProductRecommendation">Product Recommendation</a></h3>
								<p>For this project, it was requested that our team developed an algorithm to improve customer experience while purchasing on an online platform.
									<br>The two improvements developed were as follows: a "smartbasket" that would fill the shoppers baskets at the moment they log in, and a "did-you-forget" offering at the end of purchasing before checkout.</br></p>
								
								<h3> - <a hreft="">Market Basket Analysis</a></h3>
								<p>In this client's case, their restaurant is struggling to understand their market and has asked us to analyse customer patterns and item preferences so that they can adapt their offers
									<br>Besides the requisite of understanding their clients, we also had to analyze product patterns by making use of the APRIORI algorithm to analyse purchasing patterns.</br>
								</p>

								<h3> - <a hreft="">Hotel Customer Segmentation</a></h3>
								<p>In a competitive industry like hospitality, this hotel asked us to differentiate their customers based on the data they provided so they could provide a better experience to their customers and at the same time, differentiate themselves from the competition.
									<br>Although this project might appear simple, it showcases the challenges that any data science project goes through but also the benefits that could come from looking into your data.</br>
								</p>

								<h3> - <a hreft="">Hotel Booking Cancelations</a></h3>
								<p>Similarly to the previous project, this challenged our team to perform a seemingly simple task that in the long run would make a big difference in a business outcome.
									<br>We were also faced with the same data cleaning and preparation issues that plague most of these projects, but in the end we were able to provide the tools to measure actual client flow for the client.</br>
								</p>

								<h3> - <a href="https://github.com/hvjanuario/Portfolio/tree/master/PowerBI_Dashboard">PowerBI dashboard</a></h3>
								<p>This project had as a target to show key performace metrics (KPI's) to the board of a company and also to provide some advice on what direction the company strategy should evolve towards.
									<br>It was develloped in a team of five within a very short timeframe (about 2 weeks), where the team had to go through every step involved in this type of work (ETL, Schema construction for database and designing of the dashboard).</br>
									Please note that this presentation is just an example of the project capabilities and therefore will not be interactive.
								</p>
								
								<h3> - <a href="http://fm2020.herokuapp.com">Data visualization</a></h3>
								<p>The goal was to experiment with seaborn, plotly and dash capabilities and showcase the possibilities of simple applications of data visualization techniques, and how they can help in understanding better the data in a project.
